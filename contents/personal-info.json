    "Hi, I’m Nathan. I’m a second-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, where I enjoy exploring the intersection of hardware, software, and robotics. Growing up in Waterloo has given me a strong connection to the local tech community, and I’m passionate about building projects.",
    "Outside of academics, I serve as an executive and treasurer for the UW Rhythm Gaming Club and sit on the judging panel for osu!UW’s mapping competitions. More recently, I’ve begun contributing to the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group as part of the embedded systems team, where I’m excited to apply and grow my technical skills in a collaborative, project-focused environment."
